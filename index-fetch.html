        <p>
            The API that I selected is from Coin Gecko. It provides data about
            crypto currencies, including coins, exchanges, and markets. I
            found it thorugh the <a
            href="https://canvas.tufts.edu/courses/35643/pages/reading-ajax?module_item_id=668155"
            target="_blank">link on canvas</a>, which took me to <a href="https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/"
            target="_blank">this list</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API I chose has a bunch of different URL extensions that give
            users access to different aspects of crypto information. I chose
            to focus on the exchange rates between crypto currency and
            different countries' currency, so I used the /exchange_rates
            extension. From there, I wanted to print out all of the
            currencies, so I used a forEach loop to get through all the JSON
            data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This could be helpful for any sort of ecommerce website, since
            crypto currency is becoming more widely used and regarded. For
            example, El Salvador recently changed their official currency to
            Bitcoin. So for people buying El Salvadorian products from abroad,
            they would need to be aware of the exchange rate. It could also be
            used in stock market sites to inform customers of how much certain
            crypto is worth at the moment, so customers could make an educated
            decision about whether to buy or not.
